# Energy Forecast

**Energy Forecast** is a machine learning project designed to predict energy consumption and generation based on historical and real-time data. This project leverages modern data science tools and engineering best practices for building, training, evaluating, and deploying forecasting models. The repository is suitable for researchers, engineers, and organizations interested in energy analytics, smart grids, and sustainability.

## Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future energy consumption/generation.
- **Multiple Model Support**: Integrates classical (ARIMA, SARIMA) and deep learning (LSTM, GRU) models.
- **Data Pipeline**: Clean, preprocess, and engineer features from raw datasets.
- **Scalable & Modular**: Easy to extend with new models or data sources.
- **Visualization**: Plots predictions, error metrics, and model comparisons.
- **Deployment Ready**: Scripts and templates for deploying as an API or batch process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- (Optional) [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for environment management

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-hey-0/energy_forecast.git
   cd energy_forecast
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Data Preparation

1. **Place your raw data** in the `data/raw/` directory.

2. **Run the preprocessing pipeline:**

   ```bash
   python src/data/preprocess.py --input data/raw/your_raw_file.csv --output data/processed/processed_file.csv
   ```

3. Review processed data in `data/processed/`.

---

## Usage

### Running an Experiment

```bash
python src/main.py --config config/config.yaml
```

- Use `--help` for available arguments.
- Modify `config/config.yaml` to change model, data, or training parameters.

### Example (Jupyter Notebook)

Explore `notebooks/` for sample notebooks on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and comparison
- Visualization of predictions

---

## Model Training

- Train a model using the main script:
  ```bash
  python src/main.py --config config/config.yaml --mode train
  ```
- Models and logs are saved in `models/checkpoints/` and `models/artifacts/`.

---

## Evaluation

- Evaluate a trained model:
  ```bash
  python src/main.py --config config/config.yaml --mode eval
  ```
- Outputs: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, custom plots.

---

## Deployment

- **Batch Forecasting:** Use provided scripts for scheduled predictions.
- **API Deployment:** (Optional) Deploy as a REST API using FastAPI or Flask (see `src/deploy/` or deployment docs if available).

---

## Configuration

- All parameters (model, data, training) can be adjusted in `config/config.yaml`.
